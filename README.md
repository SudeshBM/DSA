Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of topics and implementations covering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. The goal is to build a solid understanding of fundamental concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and write efficient, scalable, and optimized code.

Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity
Algorithmic Complexity
Understanding the efficiency of algorithms through time and space complexity.

Order of Growth and Complexity Classes
Learn how to calculate and classify algorithms based on their growth rates.

Time Complexity Practice
Solve problems to solidify understanding of time complexity.

2. Data Structures Overview
What is a Data Structure?
Introduction to linear and non-linear data structures.

Array and Its Disadvantages
Discuss the limitations of static arrays and the advantages of dynamic arrays.

Dynamic Arrays in Python
Explanation of how Python lists work as dynamic arrays.

Custom List Implementation
Build a custom list class from scratch:

Adding len functionality
Implementing append and pop
Adding clear and search methods
Inserting and deleting elements by index or value

3. Linked Lists
Introduction to Linked Lists
Learn about singly linked lists, their structure, and their advantages over arrays.

Node Creation and Basic Operations
Create and manage nodes in a linked list:

Insertion (head, tail, middle)
Traversal
Deletion (head, tail, by value)
Search by value and index
Comparing Arrays and Linked Lists

Advanced Linked List Problems

Reversing a linked list in place
String pattern problems with linked lists

4. Stacks
Introduction to Stacks
LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure and its applications.

Stack Implementation

Using arrays
Using linked lists
Practical Problems

String reversal using stacks
Undo-redo functionality
Bracket matching and validation
